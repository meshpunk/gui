## About MeshCore

MeshCore is a lightweight, portable C++ library that enables multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects using LoRa and other packet radios. It is designed for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet.

## üîç What is MeshCore?

MeshCore now supports a range of LoRa devices, allowing for easy flashing without the need to compile firmware manually. Users can flash a pre-built binary using tools like Adafruit ESPTool and interact with the network through a serial console.
MeshCore provides the ability to create wireless mesh networks, similar to Meshtastic and Reticulum but with a focus on lightweight multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects. Unlike Meshtastic, which is tailored for casual LoRa communication, or Reticulum, which offers advanced networking, MeshCore balances simplicity with scalability, making it ideal for custom embedded solutions., where devices (nodes) can communicate over long distances by relaying messages through intermediate nodes. This is especially useful in off-grid, emergency, or tactical situations where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable.

## ‚ö° Key Features

* Multi-Hop Packet Routing ‚Äì Devices can forward messages across multiple nodes, extending range beyond a single radio's reach. MeshCore supports up to a configurable number of hops to balance network efficiency and prevent excessive traffic.
* Supports LoRa Radios ‚Äì Works with Heltec, RAK Wireless, and other LoRa-based hardware.
* Decentralized & Resilient ‚Äì No central server or internet required; the network is self-healing.
* Low Power Consumption ‚Äì Ideal for battery-powered or solar-powered devices.
* Simple to Deploy ‚Äì Pre-built example applications make it easy to get started.

## üéØ What Can You Use MeshCore For?

* Off-Grid Communication: Stay connected even in remote areas.
* Emergency Response & Disaster Recovery: Set up instant networks where infrastructure is down.
* Outdoor Activities: Hiking, camping, and adventure racing communication.
* Tactical & Security Applications: Military, law enforcement, and private security use cases.
* IoT & Sensor Networks: Collect data from remote sensors and relay it back to a central location.

## üöÄ How to Get Started

Andy Kirby has published a very useful [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1qne8uJBAc) which explains the steps for beginners.

For developers, install [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org) in Visual Studio Code.
Download & Open the MeshCore repository.
Select a Sample Application: Choose from chat, repeater, other example app.
Monitor & Communicate using the Serial Monitor (e.g., Serial USB Terminal on Android).

üìÅ Included Example Applications
* üì° Terminal Chat: Secure text communication between devices.
* üì° Simple Repeater: Extends network coverage by relaying messages.
* üì° Companion Radio: For use with an external chat app, over BLE or USB.
* üì° Room Server: A simple BBS server for shared Posts.

## RAK Wireless Board Support in PlatformIO

Before building/flashing the RAK4631 targets in this project, there is, unfortunately, some patching you have to do to your platformIO packages to make it work. There is a guide here on the process:
   [RAK Wireless: How to Perform Installation of Board Support Package in PlatformIO](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687276346775-How-To-Perform-Installation-of-Board-Support-Package-in-PlatformIO)

After building, you will need to convert the output firmware.hex file into a .uf2 file you can copy over to your RAK4631 device (after doing a full erase) by using the command `uf2conv.py -f 0xADA52840 -c firmware.hex` with the python script available from:
