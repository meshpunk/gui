# MeshPunk - LVGL with Lua for T-Deck

This project demonstrates using [LuaVGL](https://github.com/XuNeo/luavgl) on the LilyGo T-Deck device. LuaVGL is a Lua binding for LVGL that allows you to create GUIs with Lua scripts.

## Features

- Combines the power of LVGL with the simplicity of Lua scripting
- Runs on the LilyGo T-Deck
- Demonstrates touch and display capabilities
- Uses PlatformIO for easy building
- Loads Lua scripts from the filesystem
- Integrates MeshCore networking

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Main C++ code
  - `main.cpp` - Main application code
- `/data` - Data files that get uploaded to the device filesystem
  - `/lua` - Lua scripts
    - `/apps` - Lua apps
    
## Requirements

- PlatformIO
- T-Deck device
- Git (for submodules)

## Building and Development

0. `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`
1. Clone this repository
2. Initialize the submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. Open in PlatformIO
4. Edit Lua scripts in the `/data/lua` directory
5. Build and upload to your T-Deck device:
   ```
   pio run --target upload
   ```
   This will upload only the firmware, not the filesystem data.
6. To upload the filesystem data (when changing lua scripts)
   ```
   pio run --target uploadfs
   ```

## VSCode hints

You must close the serial monitor before uploadfs or it wont work.

## Usage

The example loads the `launcher.lua` script from the filesystem and displays a simple launcher UI. You can edit the Lua scripts in your IDE with proper syntax highlighting and then upload just the filesystem to quickly iterate on your UI design.

### Developing Lua Scripts

1. Edit the Lua scripts in `/data/lua`
2. Upload the filesystem with `pio run --target uploadfs`
3. The device will automatically load the updated scripts

### Adding Additional Scripts

You can create additional Lua scripts in the `/data/lua` directory. Scripts can be loaded from other scripts using `require`:

```lua
local utils = require('utils')
```

You should add your apps to `apps.toml` to have them appear in the launcher.

## PRs

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep in mind the following rules:

- should be minimal (only touch required files, minimal changes)
- respect the current code style and indentation
- be the most obvious code that will run performantly
- keep your code idiomatic unless theres a good reason not to

The goal is to make this project easy for new developers to pick up and contribute to.
